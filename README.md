Using React, NextJS13 and Typescript along with TailwindCSS I was able to create this CarHub website which showcases cars including their models, manufacturers, year of production, fuel type, and more. Started off with server side rendering, but it was slightly buggy with NextJS13 and its ability to refresh pages so I went with client side rendering at the end.


## Features

- Includes: models, manufacturers, year of production, fuel type, and more
- Client side rendering
- Incorporated: React, NextJS13, TailwindCSS, TypeScript, RapidAPI, and HeadlessUI
- Implemented advanced search functionality, filtering capabilities, combo boxes, and model elements
